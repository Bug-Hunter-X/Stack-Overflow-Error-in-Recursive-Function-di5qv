# Stack Overflow Error in Recursive Function

This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function. The function `foo()` calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. However, for large input values, the recursive calls exceed the maximum recursion depth, leading to a stack overflow error.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by using an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.
